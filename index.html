It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. <b>Nairobi National Park</b> is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife. Despite its proximity to the city and its relatively small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya's most successful rhinoceros’ sanctuaries. More than 80 species of large mammals, including all the so-called Big Five with the exception of elephants, exist in <b>Nairobi National Park</b> – hunting, fleeing, eating, mating, rearing young and dying – almost within earshot of downtown Nairobi’s traffic. The park is well worth a morning or afternoon Tour, and you have a high chance of seeing certain species, especially black rhino, which you might well miss in the bigger Kenyan parks. Although it is fenced along its northern perimeter, it is is open to the south, and the Friends of Nairobi National Park lobby hard to preserve the wildlife corridors that run between the park and the Kapiti-Kajiado Plains of the Maasai to the south. Impossibly tall <b>giraffe browse</b> from the underside of flat-topped acacia trees; bevies of graceful, high-heeled impalas vault across the track ahead of your vehicle; stocky <b>eland</b> munch the sward; <b>ostriches</b> appear to float above the landscape like giant feather dusters; and fearsome phalanxes of <b>buffalo</b> turn to face you as you drive by. Early morning, at the western end of the park, where most of the woodland is concentrated, you may be lucky enough to see a <b>leopard</b>, perhaps back from a nocturnal foray out of the park, hunting for domestic dogs. Such feline forays are becoming a bit of a problem: in 2012 there were two lionesses frequently on the loose in the Langata suburb, one of which, with four cubs, was eventually shot by Kenya Wildlife Service rangers (the cubs were saved). Spotting <b>eastern black rhinos</b> in the park is easy: it has one of the largest populations anywhere in Kenya, partly due to the perseverance of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. You’ll also see groups of the much more docile and approachable, non-native <b>southern white rhinos</b>. The park’s 400 species of <b>birds</b> include some rare Palearctic migrants from November to March, as well as all the fantastically rich local avifauna. Even if you’re fresh off the plane and ornithologically illiterate, the first glimpses of <b>ostrich, secretary bird, crowned crane</b> and the ghoulish-looking <b>marabou stork</b> never fail to impress. <b>Age restrictions:</b> None, but children need to be under control at all times

          <h2>Nairobi National Park Information </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Nairobi National Park is the only park in the World within a city center. It was the first park to be gazetted in Kenya on December 16, 1949. The park is also unique as nowhere else in the whole world exists a wildlife park with such a variety of animals and bird species so close to a capital center. Nairobi National Park is a significant rhino sanctuary for breeding and restocking other parks. It has the famous Nairobi Animal Orphanage and Nairobi Safari Park. There is also an ivory-burning monument. This is where tones of ivory were burnt as a symbol of the country’s conservation efforts for endangered rhinos and elephants. The park is located only about 8 Km from Nairobi City center. It is a Savannah ecosystem comprising different types of vegetation which include grass plains and acacia bushes. On the park’s western side is a dry forest and a river surrounded by a forest. The south side has the Athi-Kapiti Plains and Kitengela migration corridor. Dams within the park have added a further habitat, favorable to certain species of birds and other aquatic animals. The dispersed flora of the park makes it possible for different types of wildlife to co-exist. Among the animals that can be seen in the park are the black rhino, lion, leopard, cheetah, hyena, buffalo, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest, eland, Baboon, Numerous antelopes, gazelle, and over 400 species of birds.
          </p>
          <h2> Nairobi National Park Tourism </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            <b>Nairobi National Park</b> is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park's diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the <b>Nairobi Safari Walk</b> and <b>animal orphanage</b>. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week. The park's Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals' housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya's population.

            <br>Arriving in Nairobi National Park, you’ll quickly see how unique this special reserve is. Within sight of the city’s skyline, you can spot lion, rhino, giraffe, buffalo, cheetah, hyena, zebra and much more. But even though downtown Nairobi is within sight just a few miles away, this is no city zoo or theme park you’re visiting. This reserve is the real thing – the animals aren’t in cages or behind fences. They are here in the wild, by the thousands. In fact, the annual East Africa migration of wildebeest and zebra moves over the wide-open grassy plains, past acacia bush and through this most unlikely national park.

In 1989 President Moi burned 11 tons of ivory, while in 2016 Kenyatta burned 100 tonnes (the equivalent of the tusks of 6000 elephants) thus declaring war against poaching.

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Nairobi has a temperate climate marked by two seasons; the wet (April to June and October to November) and the dry (December to March and July to September). The roads can become quite difficult to navigate during the wet season and it is preferable to ensure you have a 4×4 and that you take note of the rangers number in case you get stuck. In the dry season, a normal car can make it through the park as long as you stick to the main roads.

          <h2> Tips for visiting Nairobi National Park </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            <b>Nairobi National Park</b> is 117 sq km and it can take a long time to travel from one end to the other. Leave enough time to exit the park before the gates shut. There are signposts throughout the park which you can use to navigate. There aren’t any park maps but you can log on to Google maps and work out the trails and routes from there. There several dams within the park and these are always fantastic for animal viewing. The dam near 10 is usually full of herbivores and a huge family of vultures and marabou storks. You can only visit the park in a vehicle. Many local tour companies can take you – Nairobi national park often <b>rganises tours</b> themselves. Look on their website or call to find out the latest. Do not litter. You wouldn’t believe the mess that is left in some of the picnic sites. This is a pristine wilderness with some of the most endangered animals in the world. Treat the park with respect. Don’t get out of your car. Not for the loo. Not for a picture. You can be a metre away fro a lion and not see it, and they move a lot faster than you can. You can always spot crocodiles in the first dam near the park entrance
          </p>
          <h2>Birds species in Nairobi National Park</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Nairobi National Park has over 600 species of birds. About 500 of them are permanent and migratory species in the park. There are also Zebras, Leopards, lions, Giraffes, Hippos, buffalo, antelopes, crocodiles, Cheetah and Gazelles. The herbivores use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. During the wet seasons, these animals spread over the park since there is plenty to graze on. The Nairobi Park xperiences a high number of animals during the dry season. There are small watering holes near the rivers in the park. These dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season.
